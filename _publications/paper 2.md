excerpt: "This work presents an improved version of the tool KinasePhos 3.0 using 41,421 experimentally verified kinase‑specific phosphorylation sites and 1,380 unique kinases to build 771 predictive models at group/family/individual levels, achieving average prediction accuracy ~87.2% and enhancing interpretability with SHAP feature importance."
